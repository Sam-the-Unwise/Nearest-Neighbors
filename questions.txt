1) "best_neighbors which is the number of neighbors with minimal error"
        - what do you define as minimal error

# TO DO IN MAIN:

    # plot the validation error as a function of the number of neighbors
    #       separately for each fold
    #   - Draw a bold line for the mean validation error 
    #   - draw a point to emphasize the minimum

    # Randomly createa  variable test_vold_vec
    #   - a vector with one element for each observations
    #       - elements are integers from 1 to 4
    # include a table of counts with a row for each fold (1/2/3/4) and a column 
    #   for each class (0/1)

    # Use KFoldCV with three algorithms: 
    #       (1) baseline/underfit â€“ predict most frequent class, 
    #       (2) NearestNeighborsCV, 
    #       (3) overfit 1-nearest neighbors model. Plot the resulting test 
    #               error values as a function of the data set, in order to 
    #               show that the NearestNeighborsCV is more accurate than 
    #               the other two models. Example:
