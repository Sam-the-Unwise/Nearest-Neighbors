1) when initializing validation_fold_vec with numbers 1 to num_folds, should it include num_folds or exclude it?
    Ex: numfolds = 10; validation_fold_vec = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
            or should it include 10?
1.2) also what does it mean by "randomly" create validation_fold_vec?


2) define X_new, y_new based on the observations for which the corr. elements of fold_vec are equal to the current fold ID k
