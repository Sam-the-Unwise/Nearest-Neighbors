1) also what does it mean by "randomly" create validation_fold_vec?

2) define X_new, y_new based on the observations for which the corr. elements of fold_vec are equal to the current fold ID k
    - does this mean to set both X_new and y_new to the fold ID k that we are at?
    - does this mean that we should loop through the elem
    see line 34-35

3) specify ComputePredictions = NN function that uses your programs language's? Do you mean that we are supposed to just pass
    in the function NearestNeighbors itself or...?
--> mostly I'm just confused how were supposed to pass in the function

4) for NearestNeighborsCV, what is the difference between X_new and X_mat?
