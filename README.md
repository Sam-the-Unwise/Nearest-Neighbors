# Nearest-Neighbors
Python-based coding project to code a nearest neighbors algorithm and plot the output

# Gradient-Descent
Here is a link to our Gradient Descent function: https://github.com/Sam-the-Unwise/GradientDescent/blob/master/gradientDescent.py

Our function GradientDescent takes in a set of parameters in order to compute a weight matrix containing a vector for each iteration we have. This weight matrix is used to computer a set of predicted values when we multiply our weight matrix by the test and validation data we have.  

## How to run this function
This function can be run by inputting the following information into the function call:
    X: a numpy matrix of numeric inputs {Observations x Features}
    y: a vector of binary outputs {0,1}
    stepSize: the learning rate/epsilon parameter
    max_interations: positive int that controls how many steps to take
